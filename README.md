I've been having fun learning more about image-recognition testing with SikuliX for a game that's captured my attention lately Bounty Of One!

It follows a "what You See Is What You Get" method of automated navigation for game testing.

Check out Bounty Of One on Steam if you get the chance, it is a really fun game to play: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One/
